# Raffler
A simple proof of concept for an app for raffling (not so) random students. 
The raffler has option to choose at completely random but also has some options to influence the chance of an individual student getting picked by the raffler.

- only a concept
- key features missing such as:
deleting students
editing student names
removing students from the raffle once they have been raffled

- I may also add an option to select a class of students
